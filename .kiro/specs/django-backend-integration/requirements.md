# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Django backend to support the existing SmartPay Assist AI React frontend application. The backend will provide REST APIs for user management, bill processing with AI-powered receipt scanning, payment integration with SSLCommerce, and real-time notifications. The system needs to handle user authentication, bill splitting logic, payment processing, and data persistence while maintaining security and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and authenticate with the system, so that I can securely access my bills and payment information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits registration details THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with encrypted password storage
2. WHEN a user attempts to login with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT authentication token
3. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints without valid token THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized response
4. WHEN a user's token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. IF a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload receipt images and have them processed by AI, so that bill items and amounts are automatically extracted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a receipt image THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process it using OCR/AI to extract text and identify items
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return structured data with item names, prices, and total amount
4. IF image processing fails THEN the system SHALL return an error message and allow manual entry
5. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide status updates to the frontend

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage bills with multiple participants, so that I can split expenses with friends and family.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a bill THEN the system SHALL store bill details including title, total amount, and participant list
2. WHEN a user adds participants to a bill THEN the system SHALL validate user existence and send notifications
3. WHEN bill items are assigned to participants THEN the system SHALL calculate individual payment amounts
4. WHEN payment splits are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure total amounts match the original bill
5. IF a user modifies bill assignments THEN the system SHALL recalculate payment splits automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to process payments through SSLCommerce, so that I can securely pay my share of bills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates payment THEN the system SHALL create a secure payment session with SSLCommerce
2. WHEN payment is successful THEN the system SHALL update payment status and notify relevant participants
3. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and allow retry attempts
4. IF payment is pending THEN the system SHALL track status and provide updates
5. WHEN all payments for a bill are complete THEN the system SHALL mark the bill as fully paid

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about bill updates and payment reminders, so that I stay informed about my financial obligations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is added to a bill THEN the system SHALL send a notification about the new bill
2. WHEN a payment is due THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications based on user preferences
3. WHEN a payment is completed THEN the system SHALL notify all bill participants
4. IF a user updates notification preferences THEN the system SHALL respect those settings
5. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL support multiple channels (email, in-app)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my payment history and bill statistics, so that I can track my expenses and financial activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests payment history THEN the system SHALL return paginated list of all payments
2. WHEN a user views dashboard THEN the system SHALL display pending amounts, paid amounts, and active bills
3. WHEN a user filters bills THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date range, status, and participants
4. IF a user requests bill details THEN the system SHALL return complete bill information including all participants and payments
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide accurate financial summaries and statistics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to be secure and scalable, so that user data is protected and the system can handle growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt passwords and payment information
2. WHEN processing API requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and input validation
3. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL use secure cloud storage with proper access controls
4. IF security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL log incidents and implement protective measures
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through proper database optimization and caching
